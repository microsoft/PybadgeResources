## Introduction

Congratulations, you've got yourself a PyBadge! The PyBadge is device called a *microcontroller,* a simple computer that we can program to do all sorts of fun things, like custom video games, music boxes, and more!

We can write instructions, called programs, for the PyBadge using Microsoft MakeCode Arcade which is a block-based coding platform similar to Scratch. Read on to learn more about the board and what you can make with it!

### What's on the board

* Color screen display (1.8" 160x128 Color TFT Display)
* 8 x Game/Control Buttons
* Light sensor (on front)
* Buzzer mini-speaker
* Triple-axis accelerometer (motion sensor)
* 5 x NeoPixels (lights that can change colors!)
* LiPoly battery port (recharging capabilities)
* USB port for battery charging, programming and debugging
* Mono Class-D speaker driver for 4-8 ohm speakers, up to 2 Watts
    * Like [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1313) or [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4227) speaker!
* Reset button
* On-Off switch

## Getting a MakeCode program on the PyBadge

1. Download the program:
     * In MakeCode Arcade, click "Download" and "Choose Hardware," then select "Adafruit PyBadge" on the top right.
     * The program (a .uf2 file) will save to your computer. Note where it's saved or choose a folder.
     * After this first setup, you can simply click the Download button on the MakeCode Arcade editor page.

1. Put the device into bootloader mode:
    * Double-tap the PyBadge reset button to get it to appear as a device on the computer, much like a USB drive.
    * When the board is in bootloader mode you'll see a screen similar to the above one show up.
    * Now that the board is in bootloader mode, you should see a BADGEBOOT drive show up on your computer. Drag the arcade game .uf2 file onto the drive.
4. Once the file is copied over the board will restart and launch the program!

* [Arcade Game Maker Guide](https://arcade.makecode.com/skillmap): A multi-tutorial guide for learning how to make games in MakeCode Arcade. Includes certificates for completed tutorials.

### Troubleshooting

1. Make sure you're using a data transfer USB cable (one of the most common blockers w/ hardware functioning properly).
1. You may need to update the bootloader on the PyBadge, particularly if you're working on a Mac. If you notice your board is titled "ARCADE-D51" or "BADGEBOOT", [follow this tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pybadge/updating-the-bootloader).

## Suggested Learning Path

### Lesson 0: Test Program

> Estimated time: 30 - 45 minutes.
> Recommended ages: All!

This lesson introduces participants to MakeCode Arcade and shows them how to load MakeCode programs onto the PyBadge.

1. Start by giving participants some time to explore MakeCode Arcade and create a creature or character.
2. Show participants how to download the program and load onto the PyBadge.
3. Depending on participants' experience, include 10 - 15 minutes for loading a first test program.
4. If participants finish early, encourage them to start adding to their test program by making the character move, adding a background, or exploring the on-board sensors.
5. Encourage participants to share their creations, what worked well, what was surprising, and any mysteries or questions they have.

### Lesson 1: Open-ended exploration

> Estimated time: 60 - 90 min, longer as needed
> Recommended ages: 8+

Provide participants an open-ended prompt and allow them to design and build a solution using MakeCode Arcade and the PyBadge.

It may be helpful to start with a short lesson on the **Design Thinking Process**. [Here's a helpful resource created by the Stanford D School](https://kissingergroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/An-Introduction-to-Design-Thinking.pdf).

If participants are unsure what to make, suggest they write down their values, or things they care about, and use one to motivate a project.

**Sample prompts**

* Make something for someone you love
* Make something inspired by nature
* Design a solution for an everyday problem
* Invent an instrument
* Design a game (for 2 or more people)
* Explore other prompts based on participants' interests!

### Lessons 2 and onward: Build a project!

> Estimated time: 60 min
> Recommended ages: 8+
